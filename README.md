# Full Stack Boilerplate

## Work with it

Just run `docker-compose up`. localhost:3000 for frontend, localhost:8000/docs for the api docs and localhost:8080 for the database admin. The database is spun up straight from the postgres docker image https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres whilst the frontend and backend containers have their own Dockerfiles in their respective directories.

Originally based off of this instructional video (for troubleshooting) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jx39roFmTNg&ab_channel=Docker using `create-react-app` for the frontend and some boilerplate code from https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/#create-it for the backend.
### Coming Soon

An actual site, deploy it, CI pipeline perhaps...
